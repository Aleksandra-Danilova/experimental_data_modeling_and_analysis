# Experimental Data Modeling and Analysis
Project for modeling and analisys of experimental data.

The project is a Python application that allows to model, process, and analyze both 1D and 2D signals. For example, you can simulate noise / cardiogram / Doppler effect, highlight edges and details in images, change
the stress in speech.
