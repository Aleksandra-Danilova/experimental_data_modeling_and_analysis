The folder contains the following examples of techniques:
- Gradation transformation of the MxN image by histogram equalization, where p(r_k) is the normalized histogram, k - brightness level, CDF is a distribution function, which is used for brightness recalculation for transformed image.
- Examples of enlarged / decreased sizes of images.
